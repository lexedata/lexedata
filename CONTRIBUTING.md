## Installing `lexedata` for development

The following steps aren't the one and only solution to go about it, but are reasonable defaults.

 - Make sure you have a Github account and are signed in to Github.
 - Fork `Anaphory/lexedata` (There is a button <a href="/login?return_to=%2FAnaphory%2Flexedata" rel="nofollow" data-hydro-click="{&quot;event_type&quot;:&quot;authentication.click&quot;,&quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;location_in_page&quot;:&quot;repo details fork button&quot;,&quot;repository_id&quot;:288489134,&quot;auth_type&quot;:&quot;LOG_IN&quot;,&quot;originating_url&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/Anaphory/lexedata&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:null}}" data-hydro-click-hmac="12434dbbcc05e179b4a260522173eeb34701b04feb5fe23cefd2cd566d7ff52d" aria-label="You must be signed in to fork a repository" data-view-component="true" class="tooltipped tooltipped-s btn-sm btn">  <svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" data-view-component="true" class="octicon octicon-repo-forked mr-2"> <path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M5 3.25a.75.75 0 11-1.5 0 .75.75 0 011.5 0zm0 2.122a2.25 2.25 0 10-1.5 0v.878A2.25 2.25 0 005.75 8.5h1.5v2.128a2.251 2.251 0 101.5 0V8.5h1.5a2.25 2.25 0 002.25-2.25v-.878a2.25 2.25 0 10-1.5 0v.878a.75.75 0 01-.75.75h-4.5A.75.75 0 015 6.25v-.878zm3.75 7.378a.75.75 0 11-1.5 0 .75.75 0 011.5 0zm3-8.75a.75.75 0 100-1.5.75.75 0 000 1.5z"></path> </svg>Fork <span id="repo-network-counter" data-pjax-replace="true" title="4" data-view-component="true" class="Counter">4</span> </a> on the top-right)
 - Clone your fork to your local computer, using `git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/lexedata` or one of the available GUI tools.
 - Create a Python virtual environment for Lexedata. If you use Anaconda, this works with `conda create -n lexedata python=3.9 anaconda` (or whatever name and Python version you prefer â€“ there are more details in the Anaconda documentation), and activate it.
 - Navigate inside the Lexedata clone on your machine. Install a development version of `lexedata` and its dependencies using `pip install -e .[dev,test]` and the additional packages useful or necessary for development using `pip install pre-commit tox`.
 - Install the CLDF catalogs CLTS, Glottolog, and Concepticon, as described in the [general Lexedata installation instructions](https://lexedata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
 - Run
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```
   to make sure that [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) are run as git pre-commit hooks, which will ensure the formatting of any changed code you want to contribute in the future.
 - Run
   ```
   tox
   ```
   to run the tests. Tox will install some additional packages into a dedicated virtualenv, which may also be useful for you to have in your general working environment, so you can run specific tests manually instead of the whole testing suite:
    - codecov
    - black ~= 21.6b0
    - flake8
    - flake8-breakpoint
    - pytest
    - pytest-cov
    - mypy
    - scriptdoctest@git+https://git@github.com/Anaphory/scriptdoctest.git

If you want a local version of the documentation, make sure you have `sphinx` installed. Then you can build the documentation by running `make html` (or any other [Sphinx builder](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html#cmdoption-sphinx-build-b)).
