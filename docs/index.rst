Welcome to lexedata's documentation!
====================================

Introduction
------------

Lexedata is a set of tools for managing, editing, and annotating large lexical datasets in :doc:`cross-linguistic data format (CLDF) <cldf>`. In order to use lexedata you need to be somewhat familiar with the command line and git. Below we give the basics on the CLDF data format, command line navigation and git that you need to get started, as well as some useful links for more information. Finally we describe how commands are organized in lexedata, and we introduce some terminology we will be using in the manual.

Lexedata is open access software in development. Please report any problems and suggest any improvements you would like to see by `opening an issue  <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository>`_ on the `Lexedata GitHub repository <https://github.com/Anaphory/lexedata/tree/master>`_.
