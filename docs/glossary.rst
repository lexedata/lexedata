Glossary
~~~~~~~~

In this section we explain briefly some terminology that is used in this manual and in the help of Lexedata commands.

Lexedata is CLDF-centric, so ‘export’ is always ‘away from CLDF’ and ‘import’ is always ‘towards CLDF’.

TODO: add stuff here about different cross-concept or within-concept cognate sets and how this affects things, especially coding. Also add stuff about central concept, coding methods, status column.
