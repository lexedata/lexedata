"""Test Lexedata handling of NA values

In https://github.com/cldf/cldf/issues/108, we started a discussion concerning
different types of NA values in lexical data.

CLDF formalizes the following distinction:

> Data creators often want to distinguish two kinds of missing data, in
> particular when the data is extracted from sources:
>
> 1. data that is missing/unknown because it was never extracted from the source,
> 2. data that is indicated in the source as unknown.
>
> The CSVW data model can be used to express this difference as follows: Case 1
> can be modeled by not including the relevant data as row at all. Case 2 can
> be modeled using the null property of the relevant column specification as
> value in a data row.

There is, however, a third case: Data where the source states that the
parameter value is not applicable to the language. We encode this generally by
"-", but our goal is to in the end also accept other non-empty strings that
contain no alphabetical characters, in particular "/" and "â€“".

Some source datasets use "?" to indicate cases 1 and 2, this needs to be
handled upon import.

Special handling of these three different NA forms alongside valid forms is
tested by this module. It affects multiple different components of Lexedata.
