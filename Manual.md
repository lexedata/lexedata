# `lexedata` Manual

## 1. Introduction
Lexedata is a set of tools for managing, editing, and annotating large lexical datasets in CLDF. In order to use lexedata you need to be somewhat familiar with the command line and git. Below we give the basics you need to get started.

<!-- TODO: add links for online resources for git and command line -->

### 1.1 The CLDF format
The CLDF format is designed for sharing and reusing comparative linguistic data. A CLDF lexical dataset consists of a series of .csv files, a .json file describing the structure of each .csv file and their inter-relationships, and a .bib file containing the relevant sources. A typical CLDF lexical dataset consists of the following .csv files: languages.csv, concepts.csv, forms.csv, cognatesets.csv, and cognates.csv. However, not all files are necessary, the bare minimum is forms.csv. Each .csv file has an ID column. There is the possibility to add further files depending on your needs. For more information on the CLDF format, you can refer to https://cldf.clld.org/. Below, we will briefly describe the typical files of a lexical CLDF dataset and how they interact with Lexedata when necessary. For each file, you can find below the necessary columns and typical columns. You can always add any custom columns as needed for your dataset.

We recommend that you keep all these files in one folder which is versioned with git. You can use Github or Gitlab for this purpose, see section 1.3 below.

#### 1.1.1 Languages.csv
Languages.csv contains the different varieties included in your lexical dataset and their metadata. Every row is a variety.
Necessary columns: LanguageID
Typical columns: Language name


#### 1.1.2 Concepts.csv
Concepts.csv contains the different concepts (meanings) included in your lexical dataset. Every row is a concept.
Necessary columns: ConceptID
Typical columns: Concept name, Definition

#### 1.1.3 Forms.csv

#### 1.1.4 Cognatesets.csv

#### 1.1.5 Cognates.csv

#### 1.1.6 sources.bib

#### 1.1.7 Wordlist-metadata.json

##### 1.1.7.1 How to read your metadata file

### 1.2 Navigation using the command line
On a MacOS computer you can navigate to a specific folder using the command line on your terminal as follows: 
You can see the directory (folder) you are in at the moment (current directory) within the prompt. In order to go to a directory below (contained in the current directory), type `cd [relative directory path]`, e.g. `cd Documents/arawak/data`. `cd` stands for change directory. Note that directory names are case sensitive and that they can be automatically filled in (if they are unique) by pressing the tab key. 
In order to go to a directory above (the directory containing the current directory), type `cd ..`. Note that you can type any path combining up and down steps. So, if I am in the data directory given as an example above, in order to go to the directory maweti-guarani which is within Documents, I can type `cd ../../maweti-guarani`.
At any point you can see the contents of your current directory by typing `ls`. 

<!-- Is navigation any different in different operating systems??? -->

### 1.3 Working with git
#### 1.3.1 How to set up git on your computer
#### 1.3.2 Basic git commands
<!-- Natalia: this section needs review by someone else! -->
You can use the following git commands in your terminal or you can use the GitHub Desktop application.
In order to get the latest version of a repository, navigate to the corresponding folder and type `git pull`. If the version on GitHub is different from the one on your computer, it will be updated to match the version on GitHub. If you have made changes on your local version that are not yet committed, and that affect the same files modified by someone else on GitHub (eg. both you and they edited the forms.csv), the `git pull` will abort, allowing you to commit changes before you pull.
In order to push your local version to GitHub, so it is updated, you need to first commit and then push your changes. Type `git commit` while in the repository you have modified and you will be prompted to add a commit message describing your latest changes. Then type `git push` and your local version will become the current version on GitHub (assuming that there are no conflicts to resolve). For lexical data repositories we recommend running `cldf validate Wordlist-metadata.json` before committing and pushing, so that any cldf errors are caught and corrected.

<!--TODO: how do you set up git for the command line in the first place??? Natalia doesn't remember. -->

### 1.4 Some terminology
Lexedata is CLDF-centric, so ‘Export’ is always ‘away from CLDF’ and ‘import’ is always ‘towards CLDF’.

## 2. Lexedata installation instructions

<!-- Is installation any different on other operation systems??? -->

The following instructions are for MacOS computers.

1. In order to install and use Lexedata you need to have Python 3.7 (or newer) installed.

If you are unsure if this is the case, open a terminal window and type `python
--version`. If Python 3.7 (or newer,  is installed you will see the version. If you don't have
any version of Python or it is a version of Python 2, then you need to download
and install Python 3. There are different distributions of Python and most of
them should work. A popular one that we have tested is
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Once you have
downloaded and installed Anaconda close and open the terminal again and type
`python --version` again. You should see the current version of Python 3 you
just downloaded.

If you are ever stuck with the python prompt, which starts with `>>>`, in
order to exit Python type `quit()`.

3. Install the lexedata package.
In your terminal window type `pip lexedata`. This will
install lexedata and all its dependencies on your computer and make it
automatically updatable every time you pull a new version of the Lexedata
repository from GitHub. Now you should be ready to use lexedata!

## 3. Importing data (lexedata.importer)

### 3.1 Importing a lexical dataset to CLDF from excel
Lexedata has different ways of creating a lexical dataset from raw data depending on the format the raw data are in ("long format", "matrix", "interleaved"). 
The "long format" assumes that every field in CLDF is a different column in your spreadsheet, and that each sheet of your spreadsheet is a different language. In other words, it assumes that you have a wordlist per language. The "matrix" format assumes that your spreadsheet is a comparative wordlist with different languages as different columns. You may have different kinds of information in each cell (e.g. forms and translations), as long as they are machine readable. The "interleaved" format assumes that you have alternating rows of data and cognate coding. It is similar to the "matrix" format, with the addition that under every row there is an extra row with numerical codes representing cognate classes.

#### 3.1.1 Importing a lexical dataset using the "long" format
In order to import a lexical dataset in a "long" excel format you use the following command.

```
python -m lexedata.importer.excelsinglewordlist --add-running-id <filename.xlsx>  <concept column name>  forms.csv
```
You can exclude individual sheets from being imported by using the option `--exclude-sheet <sheet name>`. @Gereon I am not sure I understand the rest of the command. I think that --concept-property TUS is so that this column is added to the concept table, instead of being treated as another language. 

#### 3.1.2 Importing a lexical dataset using the "matrix" format

#### 3.1.3 Importing a lexical dataset using the "interleaved" format

### 3.2 Adding a new language/new data to an existing lexical dataset


## 4. Editing data (lexedata.edit)

### 4.1 Linking concepts to concepticon
Lexedata can automatically link the concepts of a dataset with concept sets in the Concepticon (https://concepticon.clld.org/). In order to use this functionality, navigate to your depository and type ```python -m lexedata.enrich.guess_concepticon Wordlist-metadata.json```.
Your concepts.csv will now have two new columns: Concepticon ID and Concepticon Name. We recommend that you manually inspect these links for errors. 


### 4.2 Automatic cognate detection

### 4.3 Adding central concepts to cognate sets
```python -m lexedata.enrich.guess_concept_for_cognateset```
```--overwrite``` to overwrite existing central concepts for all cognatesets.

### 4.4 Segment forms using CLTS
In order to align forms to find correspondence sets and for automatic cognate detection, you need to segment the forms. Lexedata uses CLTS to segment the forms. To use this functionality type: ```python -m lexedata.enrich.segment_using_clts```. A column "Segments" will be filled in in your forms.csv. The segmenter makes some educated guesses and automatic corrections regarding segments (e.g. obviously wrong placed tiebars for affricates, non-IPA stress symbols, etc). All these corrections are listed in the segmenter's report for you to review.

Optional arguments:

```--metadata [METADATA]```: the metadata file of your dataset

```--overwrite```: segment all forms rather than only segment unsegmented forms (default behavior)

```--replace-form```: with this option, any automatic corrections are applied not only on the Segments column, but also on the form itself in the #form column.

<!-- Should this section be before the automatic cognate detection? Or when the automatic cognate detection is done it automatically segments as well? Finally, should we add more info about CLTS? Do you like this way of listing stuff? should I do it everywhere?-->

### 4.5 How to merge concepts

## 5. Reporting and checking data integrity (lexedata.report)
### 5.1 CLDF format validation
### 5.2 non-concatenative morphology
### 5.3 potential synonyms and homophones
### 5.4 Phonemic inventories and transcription errors

## 6. Exporting data (lexedata.exporter)
### 6.1 Cognate Table export-import loop

Lexedata offers the possibility to edit and annotate cognate set (or
root-meaning set) judgements in a spreadsheet format using the spreadsheet
editor of your choice (we have successfully used Google sheets and Microsoft
Excel, but it should work in principle on any spreadsheet editor). In order to
use this functionality, first you need to export your cognate judgements in a
Cognate Table (in xlsx format) and then re-import the modified Cognate Table
back into your lexedata lexical dataset. This process will overwrite previously
existing cognate sets and cognate judgements, as well as any associated comments
(cognate comments and cognate judgement comments).

IMPORTANT: you cannot edit the raw data (forms, translation, form comments etc)
through this process. Instead see XXX how to edit raw data in lexedata.

1. Validate your dataset using the cldf validate command
It is always a good idea to validate your dataset before and after any edits to make sure that everything is linked as it should in the cldf format.
To perform this test, navigate to your lexical dataset repository and type
```
cldf validate Wordlist-metadata.json
```
Assuming that there are not any errors or warnings you need to take care of, you can proceed to the next step.

2. Export the Cognate Table
Type 
```
python -m lexedata.exporter.cognates
```
The Cognate Table will be written to the excel file `Cognates.xlsx`.

3. Open and edit the Cognate Table in a spreadsheet editor
(You are, of course, able to upload the cognate excel into Google Sheets, and
download your changes as Excel file, which you then use for the following
re-import step.)

4. Re-import the Cognate Table in lexedata
Once you have edited and/or annotated the Cognate Table, you can update your dataset by re-importing it. Type
```
python -m lexedata.importer.cognates
```

5. Validate your dataset, to make sure that the import went smoothly
Run
```
cldf validate Wordlist-metadata.json`
```
as described in step 1. Hopefully, if you did not see any issues in step 1, you will see none now.

6. Commit and Push (publish) your new version on your dataset repository
You now have an updated version of the repository. If you want to do more
editing of cognate steps, start again at step 1.

### 6.2 Edictor export-import loop
### 6.3 Comparative Wordlist export


### 6.4 Exporting coded data for phylogenetic analyses (lexedata.exporter.phylogenetics)


## 7. How to edit data
There are two ways to edit data: through the web interface (under
construction) and through editing the .csv files in your corresponding GitHub
repository.

### 8.1 Editing raw data through GitHub
This section describes how to edit raw data through GitHub. By raw data we mean any part of the data that are not cognate set judgements, alignments and related annotations. While it is possible to edit cognate set assignments and annotations this way as well, we recommend that you use the cognate table for this purpose (see section XXX). 
Raw data are contained in three .csv files in the cldf format: concepts.csv, forms.csv, and languages.csv. Note that for small .csv files, instead of following the steps below, you can edit them directly through GitHub's web interface. 

1. pull the dataset repository from GitHub
While in the dataset repository, type `git pull`. 

2. edit the .csv files in a spreadsheet editor
Depending on what you want to edit, you can open any of the .csv files (concepts, forms, and languages) in a spreadsheet editor, edit the corresponding cells and save. 

3. validate your cldf database
Then we recommend to run from the command line, while in the dataset directory:
```cldf validate Wordlist-metadata.json```
This command will perform tests to ensure that your cldf database has no errors. 

4. commit and push your dataset to GitHub
While in the dataset repository, type `git commit` and add a commit message describing your latest changes. Then type  `git push` to publish the latest version to GitHub.
